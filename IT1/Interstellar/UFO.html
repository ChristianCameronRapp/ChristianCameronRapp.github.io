            Through out the years there has been many takes on the Unidentified Flying Objects that is UFO. <br>
            Some of the original thoughts were formed as plates. <br>
            Though is this the ideal spacecraft extraterrestrial life forms would use?

            Harvard professors suggest the cigar-shaped interstellar object <br>
            that whizzed past the sun last year could be an alien probe. <br><br>

            Oumuamua, which is the given name, is long, thin and carbon-based not ice or rock, unlike any asteroid or comet seen before.
            The appearance of the phenomenon is dark, reddish, about 400 metres long by 40 metres wide, so roughly the size and shape of a skyscraper.
            The famous theoretical physicist Stephen hawking have in the past suggested that alien spacecrafts would be cylinder shaped. <br><br>

            The Object was spotted last October whizzing past the sun, too fast to have originated in our solar system. It was declared the first interstellar object ever discovered,
            before disappearing from view in January.
            And – get this – after passing the sun, it suddenly sped up. So now some scientists are speculating extraterrestrial life. When comets pass close to stars, they release gas that can speed them up. No gas was detected from Oumuamua, but it might have been released gently.
            Though this compliments the Unidentified Flying Object to be a Spacecraft.<br><br>

            Last year, the UFO was scanned for radio signals, the results showed that it wasn't sending any. However this doesn't mean that Oumuamua wasn't an alien probe.
            Given all the facts, people can't seem to agree weather or not this indeed was an confirmation that we are not alone in this universe.

            UFO sightings have been a regular occurrence since the mid-twentieth century, but have also been very poorly documented at best. <br><br>

            Recently, however, sightings are being increasingly reported by sources that most people consider more trustworthy, and even official. In February, two professional pilots, one of a Learjet and the other a commercial airliner, spotted a similar UFO within minutes of each other over Arizona. <br><br>

            Two U.S. Air Force pilots captured the following video. There was even confirmation by the U.S. Department of Defense of a secret Pentagon program to study UFO phenomena, called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, in operation until very recently, that has since been shut down.
