   <p>Mars is one of the more interesting of planets to us, humans. <br><br>
      Newly there has been reports of Mars once containing water on it's surface. <br><br>
      Of course, The reason as to why this is so interesting is because of then there <br><br>
      might also have been other variables which is related to water, and life even may have once inhabited the planet.<br><br>
      Not only may Mars be a good match for us humans to move to it also contains a lot of rare metals, or at least what is considered rare on the Earth. <br><br>
      Steven hawking made a statement before his passing saying "If we don't colonize the Moon and Mars the human race is doomed".<br><br><br><br>
      Considering Steven hawking had a IQ of over 160, we should take his statement to consideration.
